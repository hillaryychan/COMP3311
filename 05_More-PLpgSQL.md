## Constraints

So far we have looked at several kinds of constraints:

* **attribute** (column) constraints
* **relation** (table) constraints
* **referential integrity** constraints

``` sql
create table Employee (
    id integer primary key,                     -- 'primary key' is a referential integrity constraint
    name varchar(40),
    salary real,
    age integer check (age > 15),
    worksIn intege
        references Department(id),              -- referential integrity constraint
    constraint PayOk check (salary > age*1000)  -- relation constraint
);
-- all type declarations also count as constraints
```

Column and table constraints ensure validity of **one** table.  
Referential integrity constraints ensure connections between tables are valid.

However, specifying the validity of an entire database often requires constraints involving multiple tables.

Example: we want to ensure the assets of a branch is the sum of balances of accounts held at the branch

``` sql
for all Branches b
    b.assets = (select sum(acct.balance)
                from Accounts acct
                where acct.branch = b.location)
```

### Assertions

**Assertions** are schema-level constraints. They typically involve multiple tables and express a condition which **must hold at all times**. They need to be check on each change to relevant tables. If a change would cause the check to fail, the change is rejected.

SQL syntax: `CREATE ASSERTION name CHECK (condition)`  
The condition is expressed as "there are no violations in the database"  
The implementation involves asking a query to find all violations, and checking for an empty result

Example: the # of students in any UNSW course must be <10000
``` sql
create assertion ClassSizeConstraint check (
    not exists (
        select c.id from Courses c, CourseEnrolments e
        where c.id = e.course
        group by c.id having count(e.student) > 9999
    )
);
```

Example: the asset of a bank branch is equal to the sum of its account balances
``` sql
create assertion AssetCheck check (
    not exists (
        select branchName from branches b
        where b.assets <> 
            (select sum(a.balance) from Accounts a
             where a.branch = b.location)
    )
);
```

On each update, it is expensive to:

* determine which assertions need to be checked
* run the queries which check the assertions

A database with many assertions would be way too slow, so most RDBMSs do not implement general assertions.

### Triggers

Instead of assertions, triggers are provided as a lightweight mechanism for dealing with assertions. They are a general event-based programming tool for databases.

**Triggers** a procedures stored in the database that are activated in response to database events such as `insert` and `update`

Example uses of triggers include:

* maintaining summary data
* checking schema-level constraints (assertions) on updated
* performing multi-table updates (to maintain assertions)

Triggers provide event-condition-actions (ECA) programming.  

1. An _event_ activates the trigger.
2. On activation the trigger checks a condition.
3. If the condition holds, a procedure is executed (the action)

Some typical variations on this:

* execute the action before, after or instead of the triggering event
* can refer to both old and new values of updated tuples
* can limit updated to a particular set of attributes
* perform action: for each modified tuple, once for all modified tuples

SQL "standard" syntax for defining triggers:

``` sql
CREATE TRIGGER TriggerName
{AFTER|BEFORE} Event1 [OR Event2 ...]
[FOR EACH ROW]
ON TableName
[WHEN (Condition)]
Block of Procedural/SQL Code;
```

Possible events are `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`

`FOR EACH ROW` clause:

* if present, the code is executed on each modified tuple
* if not present, code is executed on after all tuples are modified, just before the changes are finally `COMMIT`ted

#### Trigger Semantics

Triggers can be activated `BEFORE` or `AFTER` the event.

If activated `BEFORE`, it can affect the change that occurs:

* `NEW` contains "proposed" value of a changed tuple
* modifying `NEW` causes a different value to be placed in the database

If activated `AFTER`, the effects of the event are visible:

* `NEW` contains the current value of the changed tuple
* `OLD` contains the previous value of the changed tuple
* constraint checking has been done for `NEW`

Note: `OLD` does not exist for insertion and `NEW` does not exist for deletion.

Sequence of activities during database update:

![databse activity sequence](imgs/5-22_datavase-activity-sequence.png)

Reminder: `BEFORE` can modify the value of a new tuple

Consider two triggers and an **INSERT** statement:

``` sql
create trigger X before insert on T Code1;
create trigger Y after insert on T Code2;
insert into T values (a,b,c,...);
```

Sequence of events:

1. execute `Code1` for trigger `X`
2. code has access to `(a,b,c,...)` via `NEW`
3. code typically checks the values of `a,b,c,...`
4. code can modify values of `a,b,c,...` in `NEW`
5. DBMS does constraint checking as if `NEW` is inserted
6. if fails any checking, abort insertion and rollback
7. execute `Code2` for trigger `Y`
8. code has access to final version of tuple via `NEW`
9. code typically does final checking, or modifies other tables in database to ensure constraints are satisfied

Consider two triggers and an **UPDATE** statement:

``` sql
create trigger X before update on T Code1;
create trigger Y after update on T Code2;
update T set b=j,c=k where a=m;
```

Sequence of events:

1. execute `Code1` for trigger `X`
2. code has access to current version of tuple via `OLD`
3. code has access to updated version of tuple via `NEW`
4. code typically checks the new values of `b,c,...`
5. code can modify values of `a,b,c,...` in `NEW`
6. do constraint checking as if `NEW` has replaced `OLD`
7. if fails any checking, abort update and rollback
8. execute `Code2` for trigger `Y`
9. code has access to final version of tuple via `NEW`
10. code typically does final checking, or modifies other tables in database to ensure constraints are satisfied


Consider two triggers and an **DELETE** statement:

``` sql
create trigger X before delete on T Code1;
create trigger Y after delete on T Code2;
delete from T where a=m;
```

Sequence of events:

1. execute `Code1` for trigger `X`
2. code has access to `(a,b,c,...)` via `OLD`
3. code typically checks the values of `a,b,c,...`
4. DBMS does constraint checking as if `OLD` is removed
5. if fails any checking, abort deletion, restore `OLD`
6. execute `Code2` for trigger `Y`
7. code has access to about-to-be-deleted tuple via `OLD`
8. code typically does final checking, or modifies other tables in database to ensure constraints are satisfied

#### Triggers in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL triggers provide a mechanism for `INSERT`, `DELETE` or `UPDATE` events to automatically activate PLpgSQL functions.

Syntax for PostgreSQL trigger definition:

``` sql
CREATE TRIGGER TriggerName
{AFTER|BEFORE} Event1 [OR Event2 ...]
ON TableName
[ WHEN ( Condition ) ]
FOR EACH {ROW|STATEMENT}
EXECUTE PROCEDURE FunctionName(args...);
```

There is no restriction on what code can go in the function. However, a `BEFORE` function must contain one of `RETURN old;` or `RETURN new;` depending on which version of the tuple is to be used.  
If `BEFORE` trigger returns `old`, no changes occur  
If an exception is raised in a trigger function, no changes occur

Example: Ensure only valid state codes are used in a database people in USA

``` sql
create table Person (
    id integer primary key,
    ssn varchar(11) unique,
    -- ... e.g. family, given, street, town ...
    state char(2), ...
);

create table States (
    id integer primary key,
    code char(2) unique,
    --... e.g. name, area, population, flag ...
);
-- Constraint: Person.state âˆˆ (select code from States), or exists (select id from States where code=Person.state)

create trigger checkState before insert or update
on Person for each row execute procedure checkState();

create function checkState() returns trigger as $$
begin
    -- normalise the user-supplied value
    new.state = upper(trim(new.state));
    if (new.state !~ '^[A-Z][A-Z]$') then
        raise exception 'Code must be two alpha chars';
    end if;

    -- implement referential integrity check
    select * from States where code=new.state;
    if (not found) then
        raise exception 'Invalid code %',new.state;
    end if;
    return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

insert into Person
values('John',...,'Calif.',...);
-- fails with 'Statecode must be two alpha chars'

insert into Person
values('Jane',...,'NY',...);
-- insert succeeds; Jane lives in New York

update Person
set town='Sunnyvale',state='CA'
where name='Dave';
-- update succeeds; Dave moves to California

update Person
set state='OZ' where name='Pete';
-- fails with 'Invalid state code OZ'
```

Example: department salary totals

Given

``` sql
Employee(id, name, address, dept, salary, ...)
Department(id, name, manager, totSal, ...)
```

An assertion that we wish to maintain:

``` sql
create assertion TotalSalary check (
    not exists (
        select d.id from Department d
        where d.totSal <>
            (select sum(e.salary)
             from Employee e
             where e.dept = d.id)
    )
)
```

Events that might affect the validity of the database

* a new employee starts work in some department
* an employee gets a rise in salary
* an employee changes from one department to another
* an employee leaves the company

A single assertion could check for this after each change.  
With triggers, we have to program each case separately.  
Each program implements updates to ensure assertion holds.

``` sql
-- case 1: new employee arrives
create trigger TotalSalary1
after insert on Employees
for each row execute procedure totalSalary1();

create function totalSalary1() returns trigger
as $$
begin
    if (new.dept is not null) then
        update Department
        set
        totSal = totSal + new.salary
        where Department.id = new.dept;
    end if;
    return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

-- case 2: employees change department/salaries
create trigger TotalSalary2
after update on Employee
for each row execute procedure totalSalary2();

create function totalSalary2() returns trigger
as $$
begin
    update Department
    set
    totSal = totSal + new.salary
    where Department.id = new.dept;

    update Department
    set
    totSal = totSal - old.salary
    where Department.id = old.dept;

    return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

-- case 3: employee leaves
create trigger TotalSalary3
after delete on Employee
for each row execute procedure totalSalary3();

create function totalSalary3() returns trigger
as $$
begin
    if (old.dept is not null) then
        update Department
        set
        totSal = totSal - old.salary
        where Department.id = old.dept;
    end if;
    return old;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
```
