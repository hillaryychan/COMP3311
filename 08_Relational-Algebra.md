# Relational Algebra

**Relational algebra (RA)** can be viewed as a mathematical system for manipulating relations, or data manipulation language (DML) for the relational model.

Relational algebra consists of:

* **operands** - relations, or variables representing relations
* **operators** that map relations to relations
* rules for combining operands/operators into expressions
* rules for evaluating such expressions

Why is it important?  
It forms the basis for DBMS implementation. Relational algebra operations are like the machine code for DBMS.

Core relational algebra operations:

* **selection**: choosing a subset of tuples/rows
* **projections**: choosing a subset of attributes/columns
* **product**, **join**: combining relations
* **union**, **intersection**, **difference**: combining relations
* **rename**: change names of relations/attributes

Common extension include: _aggregations_, _projection++_, _division_

Select, project, join provide a powerful set of operations for building relations and extracting interesting data from them.

Adding set operations and renaming make relational algebra _complete_

## Notation

Standard treatments of relational algebra use Greek symbols.  
We will use the following notation (because it is easier to reproduce)

![notation](imgs/9-5_notation.png)

For other operations (e.g. set operations) we adopt the standard notation  
Except when typing in a text file, where `*`=intersection and `+`=union

## Describing RA Operations

We define the semantics of RA operations using:

* "conditional set" expressions; e.g. `{X | condition on X}`
* tuple notations:
    * t[AB] \(extracts attributes A and B from tuple t\)
    * [x,y,z] \(enumerated tupes; specify attribute values\)
* quantifiers, set operations, boolean operators

For each operations, we also describe it operationally (i.e. give an algorithm to compute the result, tuple-by-tuple)

All RA operators return a result of type _relation_. For convenience, we can name a result and use it later. E.g

``` sql
Temp = R op1 S op2 T
Res = Temp op3 X
-- which is equivalent to
Res = (R op1 S op2 T) op3 X
```

Each "intermediate result" has a well-defined schema.

When explaining RA operations, we will use the following relations as examples:

![RA example relations](imgs/9-8_ra-eg-relations.jpg)

## Rename

**_Rename_** provide "schema mapping"

If expression E returns a relation R(A1,A2,...,An) then `Rename[S(B1,B2,...Bn)](E)` give a relation called S containing the same set of tuples as E, but with the name of each attribute change from Ai to Bi

Rename is like the identity function on the contents of a relation.

The only thing that Rename change is the schema.

Rename can sometime be viewed as a "technical" apparatus of RA.

Sometimes we use implicit rename/project in sequences of RA operations e.g.

``` sql
--- R(a,b,c), S(c,d)
Res = Rename[Res(b,c,d)]((Project[b,c](Sel[a>5](R))) Join S)
-- vs
Tmp1 = Select[a>5](R)
Tmp2 = Project[b,c](Tmp1)
Tmp3 = Rename[Tmp3(cc,d)](S)
Tmp4 = Tmp2 Join[c=cc] Tmp3
Res = Rename[Res(b,c,d)](Tmp4)
-- vs
Tmp1(b,c) = Select[a>5](R)
Tmp2(cc,d) = S
Res(b,c,d) = Tmp1 Join[c=cc] Tmp2
```

In SQL, we achieve a similar effect by defining a set of views

## Selection

**_Selection_** returns a subset of the tuples in a relation r(R) that satisfy a specified condition C

`Sel[C](r) = {t | t ∈ r ∧ C(t)}`, where C is a boolean expression on attributes in R  
Result size: `|Sel[C](r)| ≤ |r|`  
Result schema: same as the schema of r (i.e. R)  
Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = {}
for each tulpe t in relation r
    if (C(t)) {result = result + {t}}
```

Examples of selection:

![Selection Example](imgs/9-13_selection-example.png)

Querying with relational algebra (selection):

``` sql
-- Details of all bars in The Rocks
Result = Sel[addr=The Rocks]{Bars}

-- Beers made by Sierra Nevada
SNBeers = Sel{manf=Sierra Nevada}(Beers)
Result = Rename[beer](Proj[name](SNBeers))
```

## Projection

**_Projection_** returns a set of tuples containing a subset of the attributes in the original relation.

`Proj[X](r) = {t[X] | t ∈ R}`, where r(R) and X specifies a subset of the attributes of R

Note that removing key attributes can produce duplicates.  
In RA, duplicates are **removed** from the result set, but in RDMBS, duplicates are **retained** (i.e. they use _bags_ not sets)

Result size: `|Proj[X](r) ≤ |r|`  
Result schema: R'(X)  
Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = {}
for each tuple t in relation r
    result = result + {t[X]}
```

Examples of projection:

![Projection Example](imgs/9-16_projection-example.png)

Querying with relational algebra (projection):

``` sql
-- Name of all bars
Result = Proj[name](Beers)

-- Name of drinkers who live in Newtown
Result = Proj[name](Sel[addr=Newtown](Drinkers))

-- All the breweries
Result(brewer) = Project[manf](Beers)
```

## Union and Intersection

**_Union_** combine two **compatible** relations into a single relation via set union of sets of tuples

`r1 ∪ r2 = {t | t ∈ r1 ∨ t ∈ r2}`, where r1(R),r2(R)

Result size: `|r1 ∪ r2 | ≤ |r1| + |r2|`  
Result schema: R  
Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = r1
for each tuple t in relation r2
    result = result + {t}
```

**_Intersection_** combines two **compatible** relations into a single relation via set intersection of sets of tuples. It uses the same notion of relation compatibility as union.

`r1 ∩ r2 = {t | t ∈ r1 ∧ t ∈ r2}`, where r1(R), r2(R)

Result size: `|r1 ∩ r2 | ≤ min(|r1|, |r2|)`  
Result schema: R  
Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = {}
for each tuple t in relation r1
    if (t ∈ r2 ) { result = result + {t} }
```

Example of union and intersection:

![Union and Intersection Example](imgs/9-20_union-intersection-example.png)

Querying with relational algebra (set operations):

``` sql
-- Bars where John or Gernot drinks
JohnBars = Proj[bar](Sel[drinker=John](Frequents))
GernotBars = Proj[bar](Sel[drinker=Gernot](Frequents))

Result = JohnBars union GernotBars

-- Bars where John and Gernot drink
Result = JohnBars interset GernotBars
```

## Difference

**_Difference_** finds the set of tuples that exist in one relation but do not occur in a second **comptible** relation. It usees the same notion of relation compatibility as union.

`r1 - r2 = {t | t ∈ r1 ∧ ¬ t ∈ r2}`, where r1(R), r2(R)

Note: tuples in r2, but not in r1 do not appear in the result (i.e. set difference does not equal the complement of set intersection)

Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = {}
for each tuple t in relation r1
    if (!(t ∈ r2)) {result = result + {t}}
```

Example of difference:

![Difference Example](imgs/9-23_difference-example.png)

You can see the result of the differences are **not symmmetric**

Querying with relational algebra (difference):

``` sql
-- Bars where John drinks and Gernot doesn't
JohnBars = Proj[bar](Sel[drinker=John](Frequents))
GernotBars = Proj[bar](Sel[drinker=Gernot](Frequents))
Result = JohnBars - GernotBars

-- Bars that sell VB but not New
VBBars = Proj[bar](Sel[beer=VB](Sells))
NewBars = Proj[bar](Sel[beer=New](Sells))
Result = VBBars - NewBars
```

## Product

**_Product_** (Cartesian product) combines information from two relations **pairwise** on tuples. Note: relations do not have to be union-compatible

`r × s = {(t1 : t2 ) | t1 ∈ r ∧ t2 ∈ s }`, where r(R), s(S)

Each tuple in the result contains all attribute from r and s, possible with some fields renames to avoid ambiguity.  
If `t1 = (A1...An )` and `t2 = (B1 ...Bn)` then` (t1:t2) = (A1...An,B1...Bn)`  

Result size: `|r × s| = |r|.|s|`
Result Schema: `R ∪ S`
Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = {}
    for each tuple t1 in relation r
        for each tuple t2 in relation s
            result = result + {(t1:t2)}
```

Example of product:

![Product Example](imgs/9-26_product-example.png)

## Joins

**_Natural join_** is a specialised product containing only pairs that match on **common** attributes with one of each pair of common attributes eliminated

Consider relation schema R(ABC..JKLM), S(KLMN..XYZ).  
The natural join of relations r(R) and s(S) is defined as:  
`r ⋈ s = r Join s = {(t1[ABC..J] : t2[K..XYZ]) | t1 ∈ r ∧ t2 ∈ s ∧ match }`,
where `match = t1[K] = t2[K] ∧ t1[L] = t2[L] ∧ t1[M] = t2[M]`

Algorithmic view:

``` sql
result = {}
for each tuple t1 in relation r
    for each tuple t2 in relation s
        if (matches(t1,t2))
            result = result + {combine(t1,t2)}
```

Example of natural join

![Natural Join Example](imgs/9-28_natural-join-example.png)

**_Theta join_** is a specialised product containing only pairs that match on a supplied condition C

`r ⋈ C s = {(t1:t2 ) | t1 ∈ r ∧ t2 ∈ s ∧ C(t1:t2 )}`, where r(R),s(S)

All attribute names are required to be **distinct**

Can be defined in terms of other RA operations: `r ⋈ C s = r Join[C] s = Sel[C](r × s)`

Example of theta join:

![Theta Join Example](imgs/9-30_theta-join-example.png)

(Theta join is the most frequently used join in SQL queries)

Querying with relational algebra (join):

``` sql
-- Who drinks in Newtown bars?
NewtownBars(nbar) = Sel[addr=Newtown](Bars)
Tmp = Frequents Join[bar=nbar] NewtownBars
Result(drinker) = Proj[drinker](Tmp)

-- Who drinks beers made by Carlton?
CarltonBeers = Sel[manf=Carlton](Beers)
Tmp = Likes Join[beer=name] CarltonBeers
Result(drinker) = Proj[drinker)Tmp
```

## Division

Consider two relation schemas R and S where S ⊂ R

The **_division_** operation is defined on instances r(R) and s(S) as

`r / s = r Div s = {t | t ∈ r[R-S] ∧ satisfy}`,  
where `satisfy = ∀ ts ∈ S (∃ tr ∈ R (tr[S] = ts ∧ tr [R-S] = t))`

Operationally:

* consider each subset of tuples in R that match on t[R-S]
* for this subset of tuples, take the t[S] values from each
* if this covers all tuples in S, then include t[R-S] in the result

Example of division:

![Division Example](imgs/9-33_division-example.png)

Querying with relational algebra (division):

Division handles queries that include the notion "for all"; e.g. Which beers are sold in all bars?

We can answer this as follows:

1. generate a relation of beers and bars, where they are sold; `r1 = Proj[beer,bar](Sold)`
2. generate a relation of all bars; `r2 = Rename[r2(bar)](Proj[name](Bars))`
3. find which bars appear in tuples in every bar; `res = r1 Div r2`
